System that recommends diet plan based on human disease, genetic history and also can be used to maintain health profile. 

By taking the health profile of a person, the diet plan of an individual is recommended from our web app which is backed by ML model.

Technologies we used:
Django,
Data Science , ML , AI
Bootsrap 


With help of few research papers we had gone through. we were able to genarate data of 1850 profiles of Diabetes and pre-Diabetes patients and the diet plan recommende based on their vitals and differnect readings . Then we trained ML models for multi-output problem , RandomForestRgeressor for mulitoutpt gave the best results among the models. So we have built this web app which will take the inputs and give results of the diet plan .

With a real world data and large set of data that can be collected from authentic resources , we can build this porject and add more disease profiles and normal individual profiles. which will help people not to reach out to a nutritionist.
